Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which
itself derives from [Stevie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_%28text_editor%29)).
It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and
derivatives exist, some very clever—but none are Vim. Neovim is built
for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

### Goals

Extensible. Usable. Vim.

- Retain the character of Vim—fast, versatile, quasi-minimal.
- Enable new contributors, remove barriers to entry.
- Unblock plugin authors.
- Deliver a first-class Lua interface, as an alternative to Vimscript.
- Favor composability (long-term thinking) instead of new, incompatible concepts (short-term thinking).
- Leverage ongoing Vim development.
- Optimize "out of the box", for new users but especially regular users.
- Deliver a consistent cross-platform experience, targeting all libuv-supported platforms.
- In matters of taste/ambiguity, favor tradition/compatibility...
- ...but prefer usability if the benefits are extreme.

### Non-goals

- Support Vim9script
- Turn Vim into an IDE
- Limit third-party applications (such as IDEs!) built with Neovim
- Deprecate Vimscript
- Conform to POSIX vi
