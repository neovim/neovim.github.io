      <h2>Planned features</h2>

      <h3>More powerful plugins</h3>

      <p>Neovim plans to think of plugins from the start and provide a system that allows for extension in any language. The idea is to allow plugins to be co-processes that communicate with Vim asynchronously. This allows the plugin to listen for events and to send commands to Vim at any time.</p>

      <p>Your old plugins will still work with Neovim as a compatibility layer will be provided. Little to no modification will be required.</p>

      <h3>Better GUI architecture</h3>

      <p>Neovim will focus on providing a headless text editing environment. This will allow any GUI to be written that ties into the native GUI of whatever operating system it is running on.</p>

      <h3>First-class support for embedding</h3>

      <p>Since Neovim will provide the interface to interacting with text, any program will be able to tap into this potential and be able to include Neovim commands right in the application.</p>
