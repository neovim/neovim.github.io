Files in `doc2/` are pulled into https://github.com/neovim/doc/ by
[this script](https://github.com/neovim/doc/blob/4ab2e06af98dadbd35c4282c1b18304d87f8eb59/ci/doc-index.sh#L10-L13).

This is because `neovim.io/doc/` is served by https://github.com/neovim/doc/
which is where the user documentation HTML is generated to.
