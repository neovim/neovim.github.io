> The way to "win" at open source is to be consistent and steady.

Welcome to the fourth newsletter for Neovim, the project that aims to overhaul
the Vim code base. It also hopes to provide [out of the box features][box] yet a
more powerful interface for extending the editor.

## General News

### Show off your Love

You can now add a Neovim sticker to your laptop by heading over to the [Neovim
section][unixstickers-nvim] of [Unixstickers][unixstickers-site].

Unixstickers will be donating a portion of the profits to [ICCF
Holland][unixstickers-iccf] in support of Bram Moolenar's work on Vim.

### Seeing Stars

The last newsletter detailed how Neovim reached 1,000 issues/pull requests on
its GitHub repository.

During the last two months, the repo reached over [10,000
stargazers][gh-stargazers] on Github. The repository also just tipped over the
[100 person contributor][gh-contrib] mark.

### Floobits Approved

[Floobits][floobits-site], a service that integrates with editors to make it
easier to write code together, has deprecated its Vim plugin in favor of a
plugin for Neovim.

Already Floobits says that the new plugin "has fewer bugs and performs better"
than their previous plugin. Read their entire [write up][floobits-blog] to learn
more about their thoughts or view [the repository][floobits-repo] to see the
code.

### VimConf 2014 in Japan

[Vim-jp][vim-jp-site] held their annual [VimConf conference][vim-jp-conf] over
the weekend of November 8th in Tokyo, Japan.

@Shougo, creator of many Vim plugins, gave a talk about his experience and
perspective of Neovim so far. Check out the [English version of the
slides][vim-jp-slides] to read his thoughts.

## Development News

### Refactored Plugin System

@tarruda finished [his pull request][plugin-pr] that did two things. It gave the
initial implementation of remote plugins which are going to be plugins that
run in external processes and communicate to Nvim through msgpack-rpc. Details
can be found in [`:h remote-plugin`][plugin-remote-doc].

The second change is an improvement to the existing provider infrastructure to
allow providers to be implemented in VimScript. This gives more flexibility as
previously providers needed to be implemented using msgpack. More details for
this can be found in the [`:h nvim-provider`][plugin-provider-doc].

#### Note

> If you run into issues with this new plugin system, it might be caused by
> stale files from old builds and/or old configurations.
>
> See [this comment][plugin-comment] and these two subsequent issues for more
> details: [1][plugin-1] and [2][plugin-2].

### Re-enabling iconv

[iconv][iconv-site] is a library "for use on systems which don't have one, or
whose implementation cannot convert from/to Unicode."

During the migration to CMake, the macro `USE_ICONV` was missed which was used
to indicate such a system. Thus Neovim never triggered specific encoding
conversions when needed.

@aktau has an excellent write up called [Neovim: input encoding and
you][iconv-aktau] which discusses input encoding in detail and as well as how he
discovered this issue. He created a [pull request][iconv-pr] which fixed this
and it has been merged into the master branch.

### Removing Vim Specific Integer Types (Part 2)

@elmart has returned to continue his past work ([1][int-types-part-1],
[2][int-types-part-2]) with removing Vim specific integer types in this [pull
request][int-types-pr]. This topic was first covered in the very [first
newsletter][int-types-newsletter] back in June.

The merging of this latest pull request chips away at the long standing
refactoring goal by @tarruda to [remove all project specific
types][int-types-master].

### VimL -> Lua and Vim Bug Reports

@ZyX-I is still hard at work on advancing [his VimL to Lua
translator][viml-translator]. More than **80%** of Vim commands have been
implemented in the parser.

In the process of writing the translator, he has come across various bugs
([1][viml-1], [2][viml-2], [3][viml-3], [4][viml-4], [5][viml-5]). He continues
to report them to the [vim\_dev][viml-dev] mailing list as well as contributing
patches when possible.

### Upstream Vim Patches

Since the last newsletter, a great number of Vim patches have been merged into
Neovim.

This work has been done by @splinterofchaos, @Shougo, @mhinz, @NOLFXceptMe,
@atwupack, @dkns (sorted by most number of patches ported).

You can view the complete status of the Vim patches within the autogenerated
[Vim Patch Report][vim-patch-report] on the Neovim website.

### Legacy Test Migration Part 1

After @tarruda opened up [a master issue][legacy-master] discussing legacy test
migration, the [first legacy test][legacy-first] was migrated over by @nate00.
@rainerborene then followed up with a [batch of conversions][legacy-second] and
is already working on the [next batch][legacy-third].

Previously the [legacy tests][legacy-tests] were ran by launching an instance of
Vim with the flag `-s <test file>` which enables [silent mode][legacy-silent].
This mode reads the lines as if you had typed them. The tests can be ran on
`nvim` by running `make oldtest`.

The migrations (example test: [before][legacy-before] and [after][legacy-after])
are made possible because they are now communicating to Neovim through
msgpack-rpc; the same mechanism that UI's will be using when communicating.

### Bug Fixes

#### Job Activity Bug Fix

@splinterofchaos happened to [come across a bug][job-bug] in which a job
activity's output may become corrupted. The rstream structure
could contain incomplete lines if the buffer fills up before reaching a `'\n'`
character.

To remedy this @splinterofchaos added [logic at the API level][job-pr] to find a
new-line character and return it as well. The end result is that a job's
activity is now storing `stdout` in a list instead of a string. If your code is
utilizing a job, you might want to address this.

#### Signs Bug Fix

@akkartik uncovered a bug with the [sign functionality][sign-doc] of Nvim.

The sign feature can be used to place an indicator on a given line of a buffer.
It will show up on the left side of the editor window. This is used for
debuggers, syntax linters, and various other plugins.

The bug caused nvim to not remove signs placed across multiple buffers when
using the [`:sign unplace`][sign-unplace] command.

@akkartik created a [pull request][sign-pr] to fix this and also went ahead and
updated the [CONTRIBUTING.md][info-contrib] file to include more [guidance on
cosmetic changes][sign-cosmetic].

### Homebrewed Neovim

Neovim has moved its [homebrew][homebrew-site] formula into its own repository
in the organization to make it easy to install using a tap instead of just a
formula. You can install it now with the following:

{% highlight bash %}
$ brew tap neovim/homebrew-neovim
$ brew install --HEAD neovim
{% endhighlight %}

To see more, just head over to the new repository:
[neovim/homebrew-neovim][homebrew-tap]. @colinrymer originally [suggested the
improvement][homebrew-suggestion] and @xu-cheng helped the testing and
migration.

### Marvim the Bot

@Marvim, the Neovim bot that was started by @stefan991, has seen some great
improvements by @fwalch.

These improvements include:

- Automatic generation of [nightly builds of Neovim][marvim-nightly]
- Automatically [assigning labels to pull requests][marvim-labels]
- Ability to [manually trigger a Travis build][marvim-trigger] through the
  command line.

### Reduced Clang Analyzer Warnings

@elmart has been hard at work reducing the number of warnings from the [Clang
Static Analyzer][clang-site]. He did so in four different pull requests
([1][clang-1], [2][clang-2], [3][clang-3], [4][clang-4]).
