## Something something Covid

## [0.5 Milestones](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/milestone/19)

## LSP & Tree-sitter - Maximizing Vim's potential/The future of text editing

- lightweight
- tight integration

## What is LSP

[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) is an open, JSON-RPC-based protocol for use between source code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) and servers that provide programming language-specific features.
The goal of the protocol is to allow programming language support to be implemented and distributed independently of any given editor or IDE.

[Language specific implementations and feature support](https://langserver.org/)

- (auto)completion
- Code Actions (automatic formatting, organize imports, ...)
- Go to definition
- Show method signatures
- Show/go to references
- Snippets

## What is Tree Sitter

"A really awesome parser"
"Tree sitter offers a way to navigate ASTs"
"tree-sitter queries are the new snippets"?
Error recovery
"power of vim editing == textobjects" and "tree-sitter == smarter textobjects"

@norcalli - "every file you edit (which has a treesitter grammar definition available) will have the syntactic information of what you're working on available to use for anything you want. It's like a core intelligence was added to neovim which was fundamentally missing before."
@norcalli - "Syntax highlighting is just a consequence of finally being able to understand the program you're working on. There are many, many, many other consequences which are possible, and those text objects are ones for which I'm also super excited."

Came from Atom

A presentation from the author on what Tree-sitter is and how it came to be:
[Tree-sitter - A new parsing system for programming tools - Max Brunsfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jes3bD6P0To&feature=youtu.be&t=232)

Both [`bash-language-server`](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server) and [`wasm-language-server`](https://github.com/wasm-lsp/wasm-language-server) leverage Tree-sitter behind the scenes.

### Tree-sitter and Neovim

- Semantic Highlighting: Consistent syntax highlighting.
  Performance difference between syntax highlighting from a language server and syntax highlighting from TreeSitter

- `incremental selection` Expand/contract visual selection based on the named nodes from the grammar.
- `highlight_definitions` Highlight definition and usages of the current symbol under the cursor.
- `highlight_current_scope` Highlight a block that visualizes the current scope based on the current cursor position.
- `smart_rename` Rename the symbol under the cursor within the current scope (and current file).
- `navigation` Create mappings to list and jump to definitions or next/previous usage of the object under the cursor.
- `textobjects` Define custom Tree-Sitter based text objects similar to `ip` (inner paragraph) and `ap` (a paragraph). Create mappings to easily swap and move objects.
- Syntax based code folding and Statusline Indicator.

## Lua! Lua! Lua!

Some excerpts from Justin M Keyes ["We can have nice things"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt-vmPC_-Ho) presentation at Vim Conf 2019

### Lua vs Vimscript

```text
Worse is better

Vim's missing 50%:

- Imperfect design => bad perf; macros, long lines, syntax
- Vimscript is slow: n AST, ad-hoc impl
- :vimgrep is slow, :syntax is slow
- Legacy arch: 600+ globals, high coupling, TUI assumption
- Inconsistent UI behaviour: win_getid() vs getwininfo()

```

```vim
foo.vim
  let s:sum = 0
  for i in range(1, 9999999)  " Parsed 10M times.
    let s:sum = s:sum + i     " Parsed 10M times.
  endfor                      " Parsed 10M times.
  call append('$', s:sum)
```

`ex_docmd.c:do_cmdline():`

- copies command (script line), sends to ex_docmd.c:do_one_cmd()
- ex_docmd.c:do_one_cmd() recursively parses the line
- ...everytime, for all lines in a Vimscript loop (for/while)

mention [Vim9 script](https://vimhelp.org/vim9.txt.html), the issues it addresses and any statements made by Neovim regarding compatibility.

### Lua stdlib

"Lua is designed for embedding"
"Lua is fast, LuaJit is *ridiculously* fast"
"Less is more: Lua language is super small, simple, _complete_(frozen)"

### Extensibility: Nvim is the "stdlib"

```text
Standard modules:
- inspect
- treesitter
- loop
- ... trivial to add more(mention luarocks/nvimrocks/plenary)
```

### Core Features Implemented in Lua

- [neovim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) - Collection of common configurations for the Nvim LSP client.
- [completion-nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim)  - An auto completion framework that aims to provide a better completion experience with neovim's built-in LSP.
- [diagnostic-nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/diagnostic-nvim)  - A wrapper for the default LSP diagnostics aimed to make for a more user friendly setup.
- [lsp-status.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim)  - A Neovim plugin/library for generating statusline components from the built-in LSP client.

### Extensibility: Fennel (Lisp) and MoonScript

- [Fennel(Lisp)](https://fennel-lang.org)
  - try [fennel-nvim](https://github.com/jaawerth/fennel-nvim) to auto-execute `init.fnl`
- [Aniseed](https://github.com/Olical/aniseed) - Bridges the gap between Fennel and Neovim. Aims to allow easy creation of plugins or configuration in a Clojure-like Lisp with great runtime performance.
- [Ratatoskr](https://github.com/vigoux/ratatoskr.nvim) - An experiment to use Fennel to generate queries in Neovim.
- [MoonScript](https://github.com/leafo/moonscript)
  - [nvim-moonmaker](https://github.com/svermeulen/nvim-moonmaker) - Moonscript to compiled Lua

### NVIM Dev tools - (which are the most useful?)

- [Plenary](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) Mention luarocks integration
- [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- [nlua](https://github.com/tjdevries/nlua.nvim)
- [nvim.lua](norcalli/nvim.lua)
- [nvim-luadev](https://github.com/bfredl/nvim-luadev)

- The nvim-lua family
  - Plenary/ popup.nvim, things that might become part of core
- TreeSitter: Rethinking regex : Expand region comparison and ideas for future plugins
  - speak about what could be replaced, word-motion? fancy markdown stuff, vim-exchange

### Lua Plugins and Configuration

Community member 'Nanotee' has created a collection of resources in his [Getting started using Lua in Neovim](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide) guide, that are good referene if you're starting out.
