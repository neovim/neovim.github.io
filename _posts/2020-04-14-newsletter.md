What is Neovim?
---------------

Neovim is a fork of the venerable text-editor vim, focused on extensibility and
usability. It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many
clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built
for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more. See a list of differences
via [:help vim-differences](https://neovim.io/doc/user/vim_diff.html).

What's new
----------

The [last newsletter](https://neovim.io/news/2017/12/) covered everything up to release 0.2.2 of Neovim. Two years have passed, and the project has been as busy as ever improving both user and developer experience. Along the way we released in June 2018 the version 0.3. Though this newsletter arrives late (after version 0.4 was released), we still deemed it worth to introduce 0.3 in case you missed anything (0.4 will be covered in a future newsletter):

As always, check [Following HEAD](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Following-HEAD) for any breaking changes.

#### 0.3 for Users

- A lot of work has been put into making Neovim work better with different terminal emulators, and is still ongoing (**@justinmk**, [#7664](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7664), [#7653](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7653), [#7720](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7720), [#7640](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7640), [#7624](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7624), **@florolf**, [#7676](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7676) and **@erw7** [#8408](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8408))

- Linux Users:
  - Snap packaging available (**@kalikiana**, [#7918](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7918))
  
- BSD Users:
  - Support for NetBSD (**@utkarsh009**, [#8197](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8197))
  
- Windows Users:
  - Neovim ships with common tools (**@equalsraf, @justinmk**, [#6105](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6105))
  - Building with VS2017 is now supported, see [the wiki](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#windows--msvc) (**@b-r-o-c-k**, [8084](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8084))
  - Neovim is available on [cygwin](https://github.com/cascent/neovim-cygwin)
  
 - `man.vim` improvements, uses lua for speedup (**@keidax**, [#7623](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7623))
 
 - Output from `system()` and `:!` supports multibyte chars, and also handles control chars (CR, TAB) somewhat better (**@bfredl**, [#7844](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7844))
 
 - Command mappings are supported (**@bfredl**, [#4419](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/4419))
 
 - An unmapped META key will be interpreted as Escape (**@justinmk**, [#8226](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8226))
 

 
 - New flag `msgsep` for `display` to avoid fullscreen scrolling for messages (**@bfredl**, [#8088](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8088))
   - See it in action: ![Demonstration of the new multiline message functionality](../images/news9_msgsep.gif)

 - The `--listen` command line option replaces the usage of `$NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS` (**@justinmk**, [#8247](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8247))
 
 - Neovim treats stdin as text, rather than commands. If you want to run stdin as normal mode commands, use `nvim -s -` (**@justinmk**, [#7679](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7679), **@ZyX-I**, [#6299](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6299) and **@b-r-o-c-k**,  [#8276](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8276))

#### 0.3 for Developers

- The list implementation has been hidden behind an API to foster further improvements (**@ZyX-l**, [#7708](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7708)). Developers, in particular people that port patches from vim, should have a look at [the wiki page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/List-management-in-Neovim).

- Changed API functions: 
  - `nvim_command_output` (**@justinmk**, [#7821](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7821))
  - `vim_fgets` (**@mhinz**, [#8228](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8228))

- New API functions:
  - `nvim_list_uis` **@geekodour**, [#8004](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8004))
  - `nvim_get_commands` (**@nimitbhardwaj**, **@justinmk**, [#8375](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8375))

  - `nvim_buf_attach`/`-detach` implement buffer change notifications. Using these functions, you can subscribe to events that are sent when a buffer has been updated, no matter the source or method (**@phodge**, **@KillTheMule**, [#7917](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7917))


- Channels: support buffered output and bytes sockets/stdio (**@bfredl**, [#6844](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6844))

- A proper viml expression parser is now available (**@ZyX-l**, [#7234](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7234))
  - It comes with various highlight groups, have a look at the following screen recording: ![Demonstration of expression highlighting](../images/news9_expression_highlight.gif)

  
### The near future: Upcoming

Around Neovim
-------------

### GSOC

Neovim had been accepted into the [Google Summer of Code(GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). We've had two students working on interesting developments:

- @UtkarshMe worked on [extending the UI protocol and externalizing window layout and control](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8320). Be sure to check out [his blog](https://utkarshme.github.io/blog/progress-at-the-end-of-gsoc-with-neovim) for a summary!
- @b-r-o-c-k previously [active on the windows front](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Ab-r-o-c-k+) before, implemented a [.NET API client](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8337) for Neovim.

Thanks for your awesome contributions, and thanks to the mentors @bfredl and @justinmk!

## Related projects

The wiki page of [related
projects](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects) is an evergrowing list of projects that somehow make use of Neovim's extended capabilities. Here's a gist of additions since the last newsletter: 

### Plugins

The following plugins have found their way into our [wiki](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki):

- [neomake-multiprocess](https://github.com/tracyone/neomake-multiprocess): A vim plugin for running multiple process asynchronously based on neomake
- [neopipe](https://github.com/coachshea/neo-pipe): send lines of text to an external command and display output in a scratch buffer
- [nuake](https://github.com/Lenovsky/nuake): A Quake-style terminal panel for Neovim
- [semshi](https://github.com/numirias/semshi): Semantic Highlighting for Python
- [vim-ghost](https://github.com/raghur/vim-ghost): Neovim client for GhostText browser extension ([firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghosttext/) and [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghosttext/godiecgffnchndlihlpaajjcplehddca))


### API Clients

If you thought 3 C++ clients wasn't enough, you will be happy to hear that a 4th contender has entered the arena:

- [magnum-neovim-api](https://github.com/Squareys/magnum-neovim-api)

If you happen to prefer a language with no API client listed, a good starting point are the [docs](https://neovim.io/doc/user/msgpack_rpc.html#RPC), and be sure to come talk about it on the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/neovim).

### GUIs

Three new GUIs were added since the last newsletter:

- [javafx](https://github.com/jebberjeb/javafx-neovimpane)
- [sassanh/qnvim](https://github.com/sassanh/qnvim)
- [vv](https://github.com/igorgladkoborodov/vv)


### Blog posts

Some blog posts that talk about some specifically Neovim things:

- [`Testing plugins from Neovim`](https://github.com/KillTheMule/KillTheMule.github.io/blob/master/test_plugins_from_neovim.md) walks you through using the Neovim test infrastructure for your plugin
- [`Rpc benchmarks`](https://github.com/KillTheMule/KillTheMule.github.io/blob/master/benchmark_rpc.md) shows and benchmarks different approaches in using the RPC API to create folds from a plugin.
- [`Neovim for Haskell Development `](https://mendo.zone/fun/neovim-setup-haskell/) shows how Neovim can help you with your haskell development needs



### Featured project

For quite some time @mhinz has been maintaining [neovim-remote](https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote). While only available on unices (though windows support is on the table), it solves some use cases people ask about frequently, such as:

- How can I open a file in an already existing Neovim instance?
- How can I open a file from a Neovim terminal without nesting editor instances?
- How can I remotely send a command to a running Neovim instance?

To whet your appetite, here's a little gif
