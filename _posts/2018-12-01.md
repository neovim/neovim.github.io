What is Neovim?
---------------

Neovim is a fork of the venerable text-editor vim, focused on extensibility and
usability. It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many
clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built
for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more. See a list of differences
via [:help vim-differences](https://neovim.io/doc/user/vim_diff.html).
