title: Back Neovim Through Bountysource
author: Josh Branchaud
---

[Neovim](http://github.com/neovim/neovim) is a project that seeks
to aggressively refactor [vim](http://www.vim.org/) source code. The current
vim code base is unwieldy and difficult to maintain despite a community of
developers wanting to extend and improve it. This project is an effort to
clean up the code base and bring vim to the 21st century.

[Thiago de Arruda](https://github.com/tarruda) is the person
who is spearheading this effort. He needs the support of a community excited
about Neovim to make this happen. If you can support Neovim through any size
of financial contribution, do so at
[Neovim's Bountysource page](https://www.bountysource.com/fundraisers/539-neovim-first-iteration).
Your coding contributions are also welcome, so feel free to head on over to
the [Neovim](http://github.com/neovim/neovim) project to submit issues and
pull requests.
