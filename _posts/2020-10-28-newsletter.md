What is Neovim?
---------------

Neovim is a fork of the venerable text-editor vim, focused on extensibility and
usability. It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many
clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built
for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more. See a list of differences
via [:help vim-differences](https://neovim.io/doc/user/vim_diff.html).

What's new
----------

The [last newsletter](https://neovim.io/news/2020/04/) covered the release of
Neovim v0.3.0, it is now time to do the same thing with the most exciting
Neovim release that happened since then: v0.4.4!

#### 0.4.4 for Users

- Neovim started detecting the background color of the terminal for xterm-compatible terminals (**@joshtriplett**, [#9509](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9509))

- The `'maxcombine'` option has been removed, it now always default to 6 (**@bfredl**, [#7992](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7992))

- The `'fillchars'` setting now has an `eob` option, letting users configure the character used to represent lines after the end of a buffer (previously hardcoded to `~`) (**@FriedSock**, [#8546](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8546))

- `F` has been added to the default `'shortmess'` option and `S` has been removed (**@justinmk**, [#8619](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8619), [#10136](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/10136))

- The `CursorLine` type will now be smarter: if its foreground color is not set, the text of the `CursorLine` will use the `CursorLine`'s background color and default syntax highlighting colors as foreground (**@zhou13**, [#8578](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8578)).

- The terminal UI can now support undercurl and colored underline, provided that your terminal has support for that (**@blueyed**, [#9052](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9052)).

- Neovim's `'background'` setting now defaults to `dark` to get a consistent setting across platforms (**@justinmk**, [#9205](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9205)).

- `'fillchars'` and `'listchars'` now are window-local options (**@mhinz**, [#9539](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9539)).

- The popupmenu can now be made (pseudo) transparent (**@bfredl**, [#9571](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9571)).

- Floating windows! This enables all kinds of useful features, such as [big clocks](https://github.com/iamcco/clock.nvim) (**@bfredl**, **@dzhou121**, [#6619](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6619))

- Autocommands now have a `++once` modifier to let them execute only once (**@justinmk**, [#9706](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9706))

- A new autocommand event named `CompleteChanged` has been implemented (**@chemzqm**, [#9616](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9616))

- Vim's TermDebug plugin has been ported to neovim (**@kwon-young**, [#8364](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8364)).

- The wildmenu can now be turned into a popup menu with `wildoptions=pum` (**@bfredl**, [#9607](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9607)). In fact, that's the default!

- There now are two events triggered when a UI connects to and disconnects from Neovim: UIEnter and UILeave (**@equalsraf**, [#6917](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/6917)).

- There also are `TermEnter` and `TermLeave` autocommands triggered when entering/leaving a terminal (**usama54321**, [#8550](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/8550)).
 
#### 0.4.4 for Developers

- New UI extensions:
  - The `ext_hlstate` extension allows semantic identification of builtin and syntax highlights (**@bfredl**, [#8221](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8221)).
  - The `ext_linegrid` extension sends more gradual screen updates for improved performance (**@bfredl**, [#9064](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9064)).
  - The `ext_multigrid` extension introduces the concept of a "grid" which is just a rendering surface (**@bfredl**, **@UtkarshMe** [#8455](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8455])).
  - The `ext_messages` extension enables UIs to provide an external command line (**@bfredl**, **@dzhou121** [#7466](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7466))
  - `ext_popupmenu` makes neovim send information about its popup menu (**@bfredl** [#9607](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9607)).

- New API function:
  - `nvim_buf_get_offset`: returns the byte offset of a line (**@bfredl**, [#9180](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9180))
  - `nvim_buf_is_loaded`: checks if a buffer is loaded (**@phodge**, [#7688](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7688)).
  - `nvim_create_buf`: create a new buffer (**@bredl**, [#9272](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9272))
  - `nvim_get_context`/`nvim_load_context`:  explore and restore the editor's state (**@justinmk**, [#10619](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/10619).
  - `nvim_input_mouse`: perform mouse actions (**@bfredl**, [#9429](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull9429)).
  - `nvim_open_win`: creating floating external windows 
  - `nvim_set_keymap`: sets a global mapping for a mode (**@yilin-yang**, [#9224](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9224)).
  - `nvim_win_close`: close a window (**@bfredl**, [#9667](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9667)).
  - `nvim_win_set_buf`: sets the current buffer of a window (**@justinmk**, [#9100](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9100))
  - `nvim_win_set_config`: configure the layout of a window (**@mhinz**, [#9626](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9626)).

- Changed API functions:
  - `nvim_buf_lines_event` will now send events for terminal buffers (**@justinmk**, [#8616](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/8616)).

- Neovim now always waits for a UI when launched with --embed, unless --headless is also supplied (**@bfredl**, [#9024](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/9024)).

- Neovim's libuv loop has been exposed to lua as `vim.loop` (**@zhaozg**, **@andreypopp**, [#10123](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/10123)).

### What's next?

Neovim contributors have been hard at work and added a lot of new features to v0.5.0 like an [LSP client](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) written in Lua and [TreeSitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) integration. The next Neovim release promises to be fascinating!
